# Ball-on-Plate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Introduction
  The 2 DOF Ball Balancer or Project 2 is a system that will recognize the ball's motion on the plate and adjust its orientation to ensure that the ball is in control. The MATLAB/Simulink will use a PD based control with multiple loops to control the system. The system is a vision based control experiment that will communicate the balls position and two rotary servo motors will act on this to ensure that the ball will not fall off the plate.
